        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html51 specification">Hypertext Makeup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard makeup language for <strong> creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
        Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications.</p>
        <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in this specification, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this specification.</p>
        <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity  for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler introduction to the topic.</p>
        In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not essential.</p>
