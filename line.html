<h3>HTML</h3>



<br> Hypertext Makeup Language (HTML) is the standard makeup language for <strong> creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br>

<p style="margin-top:40px;"> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. </p>

<br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
